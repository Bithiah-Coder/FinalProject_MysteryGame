# Final Project – Text-Based Mystery Game

This JavaFX project is a text-based mystery game created for my final project.
The player explores choices, gathers clues, and tries to uncover the truth.

## Files
- `Player.java` – stores player information and progress
- `SceneNode.java` – represents scenes and branching choices
- `GameEngine.java` – handles game logic and transitions
- `MysteryGameApp.java` – JavaFX GUI for the game
- `PlayerTest.java`, `SceneNodeTest.java`, `GameEngineTest.java` – test classes
- `UML_MysteryGame.txt` – UML diagram of class structure

## How to Run
1. Open the project in your IDE (like IntelliJ or Eclipse).
2. Run `MysteryGameApp.java` to launch the game.
3. Use the test classes to verify individual components.
